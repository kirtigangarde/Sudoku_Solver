A **Python program to solve Sudoku puzzles** automatically uses algorithms like backtracking to fill in the puzzle. The program takes a partially completed Sudoku grid as input and recursively tries different numbers in empty cells while following Sudoku rules (each number 1-9 must appear only once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid). If it encounters a conflict, it backtracks and tries a different number until the puzzle is solved. The solution is then displayed, solving the puzzle step by step.
